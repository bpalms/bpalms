- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bpalms
-I have installed the JASP program on my laptop which is compatable with the 64bit version however, I can not use the programme. I have uninstalled and reinstalled 4 times now with the same issue. Except I am now no longer able to even download Jasp at all. A classmate mentioned something about a .exe file. Can someone please help me
